=> Requirements :-

1. Node.js and Express.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed. If not, you can download it from Node.js.
2. User Authentication: The system uses JWT for user authentication. Users can sign up, log in, and perform actions based on their roles.
3. Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms: JWT is used for securing the API. Different roles can have different levels of access.
4. PostMan Collection: A PostMan collection is provided for testing the API. You can find it in the PostMan Collection file.
5. Task Categories or Labels: Users can organize tasks using categories or labels.
6. Due Dates, Priorities, and Status for Tasks: Users can set due dates, priorities, and status for their tasks.
7. Search and Filtering Functionality: The application supports searching and filtering to find specific tasks.
8. Database: Tasks and user information are stored in MongoDB for persistence.
9. Notifications or Reminders: Notifications or reminders are implemented for upcoming or overdue tasks.
10. Unit Tests: Critical components of the application are tested using Mocha and Chai. You can run tests using npm test.
11. Error Handling and Validation: Proper error handling and validation are implemented for incoming requests.
12. Logging: Logging is implemented for debugging and error tracking.
13. Environment Variables: Configuration and sensitive information are handled using environment variables.


=> Setup :-

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-management-nodejs.git
cd task-management-nodejs

2. Install dependencies:
npm install

3. Set up environment variables:
PORT=8000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/taskmanagement
JWT_SECRET=yoursecretkey
Update the values accordingly.

4. Run the application:
npm start
The application will be running at http://localhost:8000.


=> Authentication :-

The application uses JWT for authentication. Users can sign up, log in, and receive a token for accessing protected routes. Include the token in the Authorization header for protected endpoints

Example:
Authorization: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c


=> Endpoints :-

- POST /api/signup: User signup.
- POST /api/login: User login.
- GET /api/tasks: Get all tasks.
- GET /api/tasks/:taskId: Get a specific task.
- POST /api/tasks: Create a new task.
- PUT /api/tasks/:taskId: Update a task.
- DELETE /api/tasks/:taskId: Delete a task.
For detailed request and response examples, refer to the PostMan Collection.


=> Testing :-

Run unit tests using Mocha and Chai:
npm test


=> Database :-

The application uses MongoDB for storing tasks and user information. Make sure to have a MongoDB server running, and update the MONGODB_URI in the .env file accordingly.


=> Notifications :-

Notifications or reminders are implemented for upcoming or overdue tasks. The system checks for upcoming tasks and sends notifications.


=> Unit Tests :-

Unit tests cover critical components of the application. Run tests using 'npm test'.


=> Error Handling and Validation :-

The application includes proper error handling and validation for incoming requests. The API responds with appropriate error messages for invalid requests.


=> Logging :-

Logging is implemented using a logging library for debugging and error tracking. Logs can be found in the logs directory.


=> Environment Variables :-

Sensitive information and configuration are handled using environment variables. Update the values in the .env file as needed.
